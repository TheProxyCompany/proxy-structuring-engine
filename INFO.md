# Proxy Structuring Engine (PSE) Overview

Imagine having a personal assistant that not only listens to your requests but also organizes everything perfectly, ensuring that every task is completed in the most efficient and structured way possible. That’s what the structuring engine does for advanced AI models.

### Example:

Without PSE:
```
User: "Give me a summary of this article."
Model: "The article talks about climate change, its effects, and possible solutions."
```

With PSE:
```
User: "Give me a summary of this article."
Model: {
  "title": "Climate Change Overview",
  "summary": "The article discusses climate change, its effects, and possible solutions."
}
```

Notice how the second response is neatly structured and ready for further use, like feeding it into another system or displaying it in a user-friendly format.

## How Does It Work?

### The Armor Metaphor 🛡️

PSE acts like a **suit of armor** for language models.

- **Protection and Enhancement**: Just as armor protects a knight without changing who they are, PSE shields language models from producing messy or unstructured outputs.
- **Guided Actions**: Armor directs a knight’s movements. Similarly, PSE guides the language model to follow specific formats and structures.
- **Universal Fit**: Armor can be worn by any knight. PSE is versatile and works with various language models, enhancing their capabilities seamlessly.

### The Explorer Probes

PSE uses "walkers" that operate like **explorer probes**.

- **Self-Replication**: These walkers duplicate themselves to explore multiple paths, ensuring every possible correct response is considered.
- **Parallel Exploration**: By exploring different directions at the same time, PSE finds the best and most accurate outputs quickly.
- **Efficiency**: This method avoids backtracking, making the entire process faster and more reliable.

#### Enhanced ASCII Diagram of Walkers:

```
                Start 🎬
                  |
          +-------+-------+
          |       |       |
        Path   Path   Path
          A       B       C
         / \             / \
       D     E         F     G
```

*Walkers explore multiple paths in parallel, discarding invalid ones.*

## Core Components

### State Machine ⚙️

Imagine a **roadmap** where each intersection represents a part of the conversation. The State Machine ensures that the language model follows the best route to deliver structured and meaningful responses.

#### State Machine Diagram:

```
           +-----------+
           |   Start   |
           +-----+-----+
                 |
           +-----v-----+
           |  State 1  |
           +-----+-----+
                 |
          +------+------+
          |             |
     +----v----+   +----v----+
     | State 2 |   | State 3 |
     +----+----+   +----+----+
          |             |
          +------+------+
                 |
           +-----v-----+
           |    End    |
           +-----------+
```

*The State Machine guides the model through predefined states.*

### Walker 🚶

Walkers are like little **explorers** navigating the roadmap. They move through different states, ensuring every response fits perfectly within the defined structure.

- **Example**: If the model is generating a JSON response, the walker ensures that each key-value pair is correctly placed and formatted.

#### Walker's Journey:

```
[Start] --"name"--> [State 1] --"age"--> [State 2] --"location"--> [End]
```

*The walker progresses through states, filling in required fields.*

### Driver 🎯

The Driver is the **conductor**, coordinating how walkers interact with the language model. It ensures that only valid responses are generated, guiding the walkers along the correct paths.

- **Example**: The Driver might instruct, "Expect a string here," ensuring the model generates appropriate data.

### Token Acceptor 🛂

Think of Token Acceptors as **gatekeepers**. They decide which pieces of the response are allowed at each point, keeping everything on track.

- **Example**: In a list generation, the Token Acceptor ensures only valid items are added.

#### System Overview:

```
[Language Model 🤖]
        |
        v
[   Driver 🎯   ]
        |
        v
[State Machine ⚙️] <---> [Walker 🚶]
        |
        v
[Token Acceptor 🛂]
```

*The components work together to produce structured outputs.*

## How PSE Transforms Language Models

With PSE in place, language models become **action-oriented assistants**:

- **Structured Responses**: Outputs are neatly organized, reducing errors and making them ready for immediate use.
- **Reliable Execution**: Responses follow predefined formats, ensuring consistency across different interactions.
- **Seamless Integration**: PSE works behind the scenes, enhancing the model without requiring any changes to its core functionality.

### Example:

Without PSE:
```
User: "Generate a JSON object for a user profile."
Model: "Name: John, Age: 30, Location: New York"
```

With PSE:
```
User: "Generate a JSON object for a user profile."
Model: {
  "name": "John",
  "age": 30,
  "location": "New York"
}
```

In the second example, the output is structured and ready to be used in any system that requires a JSON format.
